# CSV Visualizer

Upload and analyze equipment data from CSV files. Built as both a web app and a desktop client.

## What it does

This tool lets you upload CSV files with equipment data and automatically generates charts and statistics. You get both a web interface (React) and a desktop app (PyQt5) that connect to the same Django backend.

Main features:
- Upload CSV files and see instant analysis
- Auto-calculated averages for flowrate, pressure, temperature
- **NEW**: Modern Doughnut and Line charts
- Download PDF reports with all your data
- Keeps history of your last 5 uploads (auto-cleanup)
- **NEW**: Delete datasets directly from UI
- Dark mode support in the web version
- Modern Desktop Client with dark theme

## Tech used

**Backend**: Django + DRF  
**Web**: React + Chart.js  
**Desktop**: PyQt5 + Matplotlib  
**Database**: SQLite  
**Misc**: Pandas for data processing, ReportLab for PDFs

## Setup

You'll need Python 3.9+ and Node.js 18+.
